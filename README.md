## 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer with Deep Learning

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer (NST)**, an AI technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another using a convolutional neural network.

### 📌 Features

* Loads and preprocesses content and style images.
* Uses a pre-trained **VGG19** model to extract features.
* Optimizes a generated image to match content and style constraints.
* Displays intermediate and final results.

### 📁 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow or PyTorch
* OpenCV / PIL for image processing
* Matplotlib (for displaying results)

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required packages.
2. Open the notebook: `Neural_Style__Transfer.ipynb`
3. Run each cell sequentially to see the content image transformed into the style of the style image.
